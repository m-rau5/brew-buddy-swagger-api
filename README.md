## Brew Buddy

Brew buddy is a neat and simple tea companion that allows users to manage their tea collection.

It lets you create favourite and owned tea lists while also making it possible to set your preffered infusion time for each one. 

It also makes tea brewing really easy! Just look at your tea list and each tea will have a timer with your preffered infusion time next to it.
